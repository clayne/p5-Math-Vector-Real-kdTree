Revision history for Perl extension Math::Vector::Real::kdTree.

0.15  Apr 14, 2015
        - add find_nearest_vector_in_box_chebyshev and find_in_box
          methods

0.14  Apr 14, 2015
        - add find_nearest_vector_in_box

0.13  Mar 11, 2015
        - improve find_two_nearest_vectors algorithm
        - add tests

0.12  Mar 11, 2015
        - add method find_two_nearest_vectors
        - dump_to_string now supports the options remark and pole_id
        - find_in_ball was broken
        - rename k_means_start to k_means_seed

0.11  Jun 2, 2014
        - find_farthest_vector was failing for the case where all the
          vectors on the tree were equal

0.10  Jun 1, 2014
        - add k_means* methods
        - add find_farthest_vector* methods
        - rename find_nearest_neighbor* methods to
          find_nearest_vector* (though, the old names are keep in
          order to preserve backward compatibility)
        - most methods have been rewritten from scratch using better
          algorithms and removing recursion when possible
        - change internal data structure
        - lots of new tests

0.09  Jun 17, 2013
        - add support for excluding more than one point in neighbor
          searching methods

        - add test for RT but #83330

0.07  Feb 15, 2013
        - insert method was broken (bug report by Greg Bronevetsky)
        - add test suite

0.06  Oct 22, 2012
        - add a clone method

0.05  Sep 21, 2012
        - insert now accepts several points and returns the index of
          the first element inserted

0.04  Jun 19, 2012
        - add hide method
        - move and _delete methods were broken
